# For engineers
You can find a number of Jupyter notebooks for:

- Computer engineering:
  + Verify that an OR-of-ANDs can be represented as a NAND-of-NANDs [link](NAND.ipynb). <details><summary>Click to expand description</summary> A sum-of-products boolean (OR of ANDS) formula can be represented using only NAND gates. The objective of the notebook is to verify this statement for a very simple case, i.e., when a formula is the AND of two ORs: <br> <img width="500" alt="rooks" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b176d1b-f328-495b-b2b6-46e0dcc6559a" />

- Mechanical engineering:
  + Find a clique in a network of compatible components [link](COMPATIBLE-COMPONENTS-CLIQUE.ipynb). <details><summary>Click to expand description</summary>Given a network, a clique is a subset of nodes in the network that are all adjacent to oneanother. The objective of this notebook is to use Z3 to find a clique in a Compatible Component Network.</details>
