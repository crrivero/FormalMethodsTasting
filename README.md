# A Taste of Formal Methods in the Field
We aim to improve formal methods exposure by developing self-contained Jupyter notebooks (using satisfiability modulo theories solvers accessed via Python) that focus on small-scale problems. These small-scale problems give a taste of formal methods to different STEM communities, namely: three institutions (a research institution, a liberal-arts college, and a community college), several computing and engineering majors (computer science, bioinformatics, computer engineering, chemical engineering, and more), and several topics and levels (introductory programming, engineering design, digital system design, databases, artificial intelligence, and more).

You can find notebooks for the following disciplines:
+ Computer scientists
+ Life scientists
+ Engineers
+ TODO: More coming!

## Running notebooks in your class

To get started, choose a notebook of your liking
and have your students copy it to their Google drive and have them go through it using Google Colab. The notebooks are intended to be run on Google Colab, and we recommend using it to avoid any compatibility issues that may arise from local installations of Jupyter.
