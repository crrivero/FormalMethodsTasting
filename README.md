# A Taste of Formal Methods in the Field
We aim to improve formal methods exposure by developing self-contained Jupyter notebooks (using satisfiability modulo theories solvers accessed via Python) that focus on small-scale problems. These small-scale problems give a taste of formal methods to different STEM communities, namely: three institutions (a research institution, a liberal-arts college, and a community college), several computing and engineering majors (computer science, bioinformatics, computer engineering, chemical engineering, and more), and several topics and levels (introductory programming, engineering design, digital system design, databases, artificial intelligence, and more).

You can find notebooks for the following disciplines:
+ Computer Scientists
+ Life scientists
+ Engineers
+ TODO: More coming!
